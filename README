LambdaJS 1.0
============

For more information, see our paper on LambdaJS:

http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gsk-essence-javascript/

- Redex/ contains our mechanized semantics in PLT Redex.  Tested with 
  PLT Scheme 4.2.3.

- LambdaJS/ contains an implementation of desugaring.  Tested with GHC 6.10.4.
  This software uses packages available on Hackage.

- DisableXHR/ contains an implementation of our safe-subset example.  Tested
  with GHC 6.10.4.  This tool requires the LambdaJS Haskell package to be built
  and installed first.

LambdaJS 2.0+
=============

We are not maintaining this implementation of LambdaJS. We are developing
the next version here:

  http://github.com/arjunguha/ML-LambdaJS

Our goals are to clean up the presentation of desugaring and update LambdaJS
to support ES5.
